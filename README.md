## About Me

# 👋 Hey there, I'm Bornov!

> a.k.a **WizB** 

I'm an ECE undergrad at NIT Silchar with my compass locked onto **Cybersecurity**, especially the **DFIR and Threat Hunting** side of things. 

### 🔥 What drives me?
I’m not the most disciplined, but more of a spontaneous spark. Give me a purpose, and I’ll burn through distractions (RIP to my 400GB Steam library 💀). I believe in raw progress, deep focus, and carving my own path.

> My personal cybersec journey — complete with learnings, tools, configs, and some poetic chaos. If you're into red teaming or just starting your own path, maybe you'll find a spark in there too.
