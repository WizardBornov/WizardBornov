## About Me

# 👋 Hey there, I'm Bornov!

> a.k.a **WizB** 

I'm an ECE undergrad at NIT Silchar with my compass locked onto **Cybersecurity**, especially the **Red Teaming** side of things. I vibe with terminals, exploits, and peeling back digital layers — but my core? Always learning, always evolving.

### 🧠 Current Phase:
- 🛠 Diving deep into Networking
- ⚔️ Learning tools like `Nmap`, `Wireshark`, etc
- 🐧Building a strong foundation in Linux
- 💀 Developing a Red Team mindset
- ✍️ Blogging my journey — one log at a time

### 🔥 What drives me?
I’m not the most disciplined, but more of a spontaneous spark. Give me a purpose, and I’ll burn through distractions (RIP to my 400GB Steam library 💀). I believe in raw progress, deep focus, and carving my own path — one script, one exploit, one story at a time.
